# PC Repair Toolkit

A comprehensive, cross-platform solution for diagnosing and fixing computer issues.

## Vision

The PC Repair Toolkit aims to be a one-stop solution for diagnosing and repairing various computer issues across multiple operating systems. Whether you're dealing with boot problems, hardware failures, network issues, or performance bottlenecks, this toolkit provides both automated and guided solutions to get your system back up and running.

## Features (Planned)

- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**
  - Boot system analysis
  - Hardware diagnostics
  - Network troubleshooting
  - Operating system integrity checks
  - Performance analysis
  - Security scanning

- **Automated Repairs**
  - Boot repair (MBR/GPT, bootloader)
  - Hardware troubleshooting
  - Network configuration fixes
  - OS repair and recovery
  - Performance optimization
  - Security cleanup and hardening

- **Multiple User Interfaces**
  - Command-line interface (CLI)
  - Terminal-based UI (TUI)
  - Web-based interface
  - Graphical UI (GUI)

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - macOS

## Current Status

This project is currently in the early development phase. We started with boot repair scripts for Linux systems and are expanding to a comprehensive toolkit.

### Available Now
- Boot diagnostics and repair for Linux systems
- Command-line interface

### Coming Soon
- Hardware diagnostics
- Network troubleshooting
- Performance optimization
- Windows and macOS support
- Web and graphical interfaces
