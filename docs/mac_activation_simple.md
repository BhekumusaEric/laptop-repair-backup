# Simple Mac Activation Lock Removal Guide

This guide provides easy-to-follow instructions for removing Activation Lock from Mac devices. It's designed for non-technical users who need to regain access to their Mac when they've forgotten their Apple ID password or need to access a family member's device.

## What is Activation Lock?

Activation Lock is a security feature that helps protect your Mac if it's lost or stolen. It's automatically enabled when you turn on Find My Mac. When Activation Lock is on, your Apple ID and password are required before anyone can:

- Erase and reactivate your Mac
- Turn off Find My Mac
- Sign in with a different Apple ID

While this is a great security feature, it can cause problems if you forget your Apple ID password or need to access a device that belonged to someone else.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. **Proof of purchase** for the Mac (receipt, invoice, etc.)
2. **Government-issued ID** that matches the name on the proof of purchase
3. **The Mac's serial number** (visible on the Activation Lock screen)

## Option 1: I Forgot My Apple ID Password

If you remember your Apple ID but forgot the password:

1. Visit **iforgot.apple.com** on any device
2. Enter your Apple ID email address
3. Follow Apple's instructions to reset your password

This is the simplest solution and preserves all your data.

## Option 2: Contact Apple Support (Recommended)

Apple Support can help remove Activation Lock if you have proof of purchase:

### What you'll need:
1. Your Mac's serial number
2. Proof of purchase (original receipt with your name and the serial number)
3. Your government-issued ID

### Steps:
1. Call Apple Support: 1-800-275-2273 (US) or your local Apple Support number
2. Tell them you need help with Activation Lock removal
3. Explain that you have proof of purchase
4. Follow their instructions to submit your documentation

This is the official and most reliable method.

## Option 3: Reset Using Recovery Mode

You can try to reset your Mac using Recovery Mode:

**WARNING: This will erase all data on your Mac!**

1. Shut down your Mac completely
2. Press and hold the power button until you see "Loading startup options"
3. Click "Options" and then "Continue"
4. Select "Disk Utility" and click "Continue"
5. Select your main drive (usually "Macintosh HD")
6. Click "Erase" at the top of the window
7. Confirm and wait for the process to complete
8. Close Disk Utility
9. Select "Reinstall macOS" and follow the instructions

### For older Macs (2017 or earlier):
1. Shut down your Mac completely
2. Turn on your Mac and immediately press and hold: Command (‚åò) + R
3. Keep holding until you see the Apple logo or spinning globe
4. Select "Disk Utility" and click "Continue"
5. Select your main drive (usually "Macintosh HD")
6. Click "Erase" at the top of the window
7. Confirm and wait for the process to complete
8. Close Disk Utility
9. Select "Reinstall macOS" and follow the instructions

During setup, you may be able to skip the Activation Lock screen.

**Remember:** This erases ALL your data. Only use if you have backups or don't need the data.

## Option 4: Visit an Apple Store in Person

Sometimes, visiting an Apple Store in person is the easiest solution:

4. They can often remove Activation Lock on the spot

## Option 5: Family Member Access

If this Mac belonged to a family member who has passed away:

### Option 1: Digital Legacy Program (for newer Macs)
If your family member set you up as a Legacy Contact:
1. Visit digital-legacy.apple.com
2. Click "Request Access"
3. Enter their Apple ID
4. Upload a copy of the death certificate
5. Enter the access key they provided to you

### Option 2: Contact Apple Support with documentation
1. Gather: Death certificate, proof of relation, and proof of Mac ownership
2. Contact Apple Support at 1-800-275-2273 (US)
3. Explain your situation and follow their guidance
